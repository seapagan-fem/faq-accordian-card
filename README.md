## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Styling the images was a challenge. While the finished page looks close to the
brief, I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it. However, I did learn a lot
about multiple background images and the css `background-image` style plus it's
associated `background-position` and `background-size` tags.

Hopefully my Semantic HTML is better this time too.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp)
  - This helped me to understand the multiple property values for
    `background-position`, especially the `x% y%` syntax I ended up using for
    the shadow image on desktop resolution.
